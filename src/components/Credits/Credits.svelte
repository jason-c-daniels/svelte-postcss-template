        <h3>My contributions</h3>
        <p> I created this project when looking to learn more about both Svelte and CSS3 custom properties.
            Since I'm a n00b, and old, I wanted simplicity out of a template that allowed me to store style info
            separate from markup and code. I didn't find a single template project that met my wants. So I made my own.
            My real role here was as integrator of others' works, as well as providing an opinionated structure for
            storing the files and handling global style information. (Inspect the GlobalCss component for more info)
        </p>
