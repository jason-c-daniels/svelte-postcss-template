<!-- Put imports of global CSS in here.
     By default normalize.css and global.css are imported.
     Other valid items to consider are font-face declarations.
     normalize.css is a type of reset.css. Tweak it as appropriate to your project.
     If you're looking for an opinionated set of cross browser consistent settings,
     use sanitize.css instead of normalize.

     global.css defines global custom variables. If you are tempted to put style overrides
     to normalize.css in it, don't do it. it violates the DRY principle.

    TL;DR: remember to only use one of 'reset.css', 'normalize.css', 'sanitize.css'.
    put global css variables in global.css.

<style global>
    @import "global.css";
    @import "normalize.css";
</style>
